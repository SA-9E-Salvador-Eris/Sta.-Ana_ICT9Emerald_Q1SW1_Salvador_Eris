Name: Bomb Guy</p>
<p>Inspiration: Guy who makes homemade bombs, Oppenheimer</p>
<p>Short Description: Not much is known about the bomb guy but we do know he makes homemade explosives like dynamites and even the atomic bomb. He has no goal or endgame for creating these bombs. Or any that we know of. He could be making them for acts of terrorism against the government or he may be doing this for complete enjoyment and sadism.</p>
<p>Abilities: High IQ, can create the atomic bomb with homemade materials. High tolerance to pain, can survive multiple bombs and dynamites firing at one another with only a face sheild protecting him.</p>

<p>Fun Fact: Bomb guy was originally a minor joke character for a Christmas Short Film I made for Christmas Party. I eventually animated another scene for Bomb Guy after that.</p>
