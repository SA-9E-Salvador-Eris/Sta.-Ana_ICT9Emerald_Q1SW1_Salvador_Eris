Name: Trafford Vickers</p>
<p>Alias/Aliases: TV, the host</p>
<p>Inspiration: Talk show hosts, Vox from Hazbin Hotel</p>
<p>Short Description: The host of The Excessively Exhaustingly Late Midnight Show with Trafford Vickers. He is an eccentric talk show host who is trying to be polite and just wants someone to talk to but the nature of the show and the nature of his program leads to the very tragic end of his guests. His show exists outside of the mortal world, it exists outside of time and space. He was created for the sole purpose of punishing the wrong.</p>
<p>Abilities: Immortal, will last as long as humanity does. Has access to the mortal world despite being outside of it. Immune to pain.</p>

<p>Fun Fact: Trafford is actually a character I made for a school project.
